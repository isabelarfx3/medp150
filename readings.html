<p><b>“In Plato’s Cave” by Susan Sontag</b></p>
<p><img src="dyingrose.jpg" width="400px"></p>
<p>When my family received our first digital camera, my friends and I would constantly take pictures, mainly of ourselves, to show case our top model skills (this was when America’s Next Top Model was thee show to watch). We wanted to feel like we could be in magazines or on billboards, and much of that has stuck with me as I’ve grown up taking photos.<br/></p>
<p>Much like the 15th century artists who began painting detailed self-portraits, I too wanted to document elaborate or intricate “selfies” that would forever be frozen in time. Images that made me feel strong, powerful, <i>beautiful</i>, because I often didn’t feel that way when I was not behind a camera. Taking so many pictures until I got the <i>right</i> one because then I could look back at them and say, “ah, yes. This is what I want to see myself as. This is what I wish I looked like every second of every day.” While that little voice still pops into my head, as an almost 30-year-old woman with two kids, a changed physique, and some more wisdom, I can accept when the photo is not the “right” one. For a long time, to me, photography had often been about beauty, capturing the spectacle of aesthetics. But as much as beauty is held in high regards, photography is also about truth telling, and the beauty remains true even if the angles, lighting, and editing are not there to crutch onto.<br/></p>
<p>The frozen forever moments are taken to capture the sparkle, or essence within us and the world around us. To represent who and what we are at that given moment, even if the outside world deems them “ugly” or “undesirable”. Whether it be a self-portrait taken by a professional, a bathroom selfie, a withering flower laying on broken, littered concrete, graffiti, the clouds in the sky, etc., there is (what I like to say) art in everything; <i>I am art, and art is me</i>. No, objects cannot literally describe or see themselves as this art I’m referring to, but as the producer of the image, I take on that role. The withering roses are themselves, naturally living the way they are, unknowing that another even recognizes them as beautiful. We as humans subscribe to that definition. And no, the roses can’t look at the image and say, “wow I feel so seen”, but does that mean they shouldn’t be seen?<br/></p>
That same sentiment goes for human beings as well. As someone who has struggled with beauty, body image, and all-around self-love, I know I am not alone in this world when it comes to those ideas. Everyone deserves to see themselves as the star of their life, the star on the front page of a magazine or billboard. As the photographer, and just another human being living in this world, I love creating that moment. The world is saturated with trauma, violence, oppression, things that are extremely difficult to deal with and move past, but at the same time, life is filled with joy, love, beauty, and reclamation. My photography and image making call on those moments, not to exploit or appropriate or diminish what is happening around us, but as a reminder to find pleasure within it and most importantly within ourselves.</p>




<p><b> "With ‘AI slop’ distorting our reality, the world is sleepwalking into disaster" by Nesrine Malik</b></p>
  <p><img src="AI.jpg" width="400px"></p>

  <p>Nesrine Malik made several insightful points throughout her article regarding AI. The main one that I took away was the negativity surrounding AI as it rises in popularity. AI is another visual tool used to mis/disinform citizens about the world, and more often than not continues to divide human beings with violent, fetishized, fantasized imagery, as well as casual which further helps to confuse the masses (could AI really be all bad if you can create a video with 1000 cute kittens trying to catch a laser pointer?).</p>
  <p>Malik spoke a lot about the visual image side of AI and what that is doing to our psyches. One thing about human beings is that we like visuals and unfortunately will use pictures or videos to not have to do research or put in any extra work to find out real, valuable information. In the age of the Internet especially, visuals are key and a major thing that comes with the democratization of the Internet is the free will people have to produce content, whether it’s good, bad, or there for the sake of being there.  “Take a picture or it didn’t happen” is the kind of world we live in, knowing that photos/videos can be staged and produced by persuasive creators for the viewing and entertainment of naïve consumers.</p>
  <p>The reason they don’t have specific classes about propaganda in grade schools is the same reason why they don’t teach media literacy from a young age. Somebody in this world would lose money. Malik mentions an older relative who believes the stories of the AI content that is sent to them, and I think it’s safe to say many of us know someone from an older generation who does the exact same thing. AI may not be new, but its accessibility in our lives definitely is. This side of life is not yet taught in school therefore it’s not taught at home; it is almost a privilege to have some sort of media literacy training or be around someone who can help you navigate through the world of mis/disinformation. If we were all able to tell what was created (or generated I should say) for the sake of pushing an agenda, and what is actual reality, then there would be no reason to have fears, anxiety, political/social opinions, buy/consume, etc., something that I believe the capitalism we experience in the US society thrives off of.</p>
  <p>In some ways, I do see AI as an art form, especially if it’s created by human hands with the intention to provoke thought, questions, conversations, communities, but overall, it seems to be the opposite; a tool used to disregard the artist and their talent, and to help speed up the production of content…Not to mention, AI is horrible for the environment, so if the propaganda doesn’t lead us to some type of civil war that demolishes us and our society, the rapid destruction of our planet will certainly do that.</p>


<p><b> Graphic Novel: Motherhood in crisis, by Laurence Ivil, Alicia Prager and Saidu Bah, Al Jazeera</b></p>
<p><img src="kadiatu.jpg" width="400px"></p>
  <p>We were asked to read Graphic Novel: Motherhood in crisis, by Laurence Ivil, Alicia Prager and Saidu Bah, Al Jazeera. I read, Kadiatu: The grieving mother ‘The devil at my Door’, which was a powerful story of a woman, Kadiatu, from Sierra Leone who had given birth many times, but her children kept passing away. In the end she is able to save herself, and two of her children by going to hospital to (1) give birth and (2) help her son who was experiencing illness symptoms like his siblings that could have resulted in his death if not treated.</p>
  <p>The creators of this graphic novel series wrote the stories in a comic book format featuring illustrations, comic book thought/talking bubbles, and even the same font to write text. The series also had real life photographs in it, which was very effective for me because it made these non-fiction stories more real. They were not just a story that someone came up with regarding a specific topic. This was a really smart way to get readers engaged, not only with the novel itself, but also with the subject matter: the harsh realities of dealing with healthcare that Sierra Leonean women face.</p>
  <p>Many people like reading comic books and enjoy the style they are created in, which already opens the door to interest and curiosity.  Outside of comic books, I would even argue that many people, young or older, love a book with pictures. They are fun to read, and the visuals are already provided; you don’t have to use your imagination because someone took the time to really paint (literally) the story out for you. At the end of the story, they had a video from a Sierra Leonean doctor, who also helped paint a picture by providing (oral) information regarding the challenges of illnesses children face in the country. A powerful trifecta: illustration, text, and real-life oral commentary.</p>
  <p>The way the creators produced the series allows you to be able to read the novel’s online or over the phone, which means they are accessible and easily shareable (good for foot traffic). This means that not only can many people access the novel’s, but they are also able to engage in the subject matter, something they may have never thought about or heard of before reading the series. The creators were really smart to produce work like this, not only for its stylistic component, but for the way they are giving back to the women of Sierra Leone, telling their stories and advocating for others to step out of their bubbles and into the global reality of what others face living in a different part of the world.<p>



<p><b> The Rising Risk, and How We Stop It, by W. J. Hennigan, NY Times</b></p>
<p><img src="wjhennigan.jpg" width="400px"></p>
<p>W. J. Hennigan’s article on global nuclear war was not only insightful on the catastrophic danger that a major nuclear war could cause on civilians and the environment, but visually, it was one of a kind (and first of its kind for myself). I have never read a news article that incorporated text, graphics, images, and videos all in one like that. Often times when I see articles, they may have several of the media texts listed above, but they are crafted into the article in a “2D” sort of way, as if they were going to be printed in a newspaper. This article felt interactive which made me engage even more with the content being presented. It was very much like “going” to a digital museum.</p>

<p>There was something really special about scrolling through the article knowing that you could enter into a graphics, video, of visually informational portion at any moment. While still on theme, the imagery took you away from the traditional article format and entered you into an illustrative world of data. One that was supported by info graphics, illustrated graphics and videos to help drive the point home and most importantly create a sense of urgency to the issue at hand. Every single piece of the article flowed together mixing information and data with art. The visuals used at the beginning of the article (and used later on in other sections) made you feel like you were in a literal bomb, or bomb chamber, the illustrations created an emotional response to the words being read, videos and other real life images helped maintain that the information is both a historical and contemporary <i>reality</i>. It's not a script for a fictional movie that we can watch in the comfort of our own homes; all of this is based on real events of the past and present circumstances that can socially, economically, politically, and environmentally change our world as we know it.</p>

<p>An article like this has a lot of power to move individuals who do not often engage with news sites/articles to actually engage with the story. The text is broken up appropriately, so it doesn’t feel like you’re just reading one long jargon filled info dump; it is appealing especially in the age of smartphones, social media, and digitality. The user friendliness of the article makes you want to keep gathering the information. For example, the videos are played in a constant loop where you don’t have to mess with any buttons to play/pause, you are able to mute/unmute the audio as much as you please, and if you have the audio unmuted once you scroll past the video to a certain point the audio stops on its own so you don’t have to scroll all the way back up in order to read without background noise. There are no annoying ads popping up and distracting you from the important topic, there is only information being used in a compelling way to drive the point home; one that all global citizens should be aware of because if something like this nuclear war were to happen it would be detrimental to all of us. I really enjoyed reading this article. It was different and compelled me to keep reading because I didn’t know what would be next or what I would miss if I didn’t keep scrolling.</p>
