  <p>The first image of traffic going down Lexington Avenue captured an intriguing view of city life mixed with Hunter life. In New York City, colleges are woven into the infrastructure, they are not separated by walls or suburbia.<br/> They are ingrained in the culture of what New York has to offer. The photo was taken at the peak of the afternoon on a Friday when everyone is ready to wind down from the week and begin their weekend fun.<br/> You’re able to see a mix of students and everyday residents coming and going from one place to another. It feels lively and industrious, as both people and traffic bustle along the busy avenue.</p>

<p>My second image is cropped, from a scene not too far off from the first but angled more towards the train station and food trucks.<br/> Another energetic, bustling image, but this time I chose something to focus on which were the food trucks.<br/> The yellow and blue umbrellas of the hot dog stand really popped out to me (literally, it felt like they were 3D), and the array of colors on the smaller food truck across the street struck the idea of “carnival” in my mind.</p>
