<p>I chose to focus on my first collage on human rights, specifically the struggles and dehumanization going on in the Congo (DRC), Palestine, and Sudan. I used several different images in this collage that I downloaded from Unsplash.</p>
<p>The background represents the colors of each country’s flag and has a floral shape in the center meant to represent life, as well as a symbol of mourning. On the left side of the image, you see a protest with revolutionary fists in the air as well as posters with pro-human/anti war messages. On the right side of the image, there are children from each country affected by the atrocities. I also added some adjustments (see layers photo) to highlight the reds/yellows in the image and bring in a sense of warmth and power.</p>

<p>Children are at the forefront of this image because they have been specifically highlighted throughout the wars, suffering from malnutrition, illness, loss of limbs, loss of families, and unfortunately loss of life. I kept the little girl with the poster facing backwards visible not only because she is a child calling out the dark side of humanity, but as an emblem for the child within all of us. Children are the future; it cannot be cliché when it’s true. We must protect and build them up at all costs while they are small or else we will continue to have hurting adults who hurt whatever or whomever is around them.</p>

<p>“What to do while in limbo</p>
<p>Do I go</p>
<p>Do I lose myself or</p>
<p>Let it go</p>
<p>Battle for my mind”</p>

<p>This is quote I found while making my second collage which is dedicated to mental health/illness, something very personal to me. As someone who has struggled with mental health, as well as watched some of those closest to me deal with their own illnesses, it is important to me to highlight the topic, and continue this narrative that we are not alone; we are more alike than we think; we think we hurt alone, but really it might be easier (and less painful) to hurt together.</p>
<p>The background images are meant to represent psychiatry (medication) and psychotherapy (Rorschach Test) showing how the two disciplines intertwine. In the middle/foreground you see tiny figures, frozen, looking down at pills, showing the contemplation of being stuck in mental warfare or jumping into the unknown of how medication can either help or bring on side effects. The words around the figures describe different adjectives/aliments associated with mental illness.</p>
<p>I added exposure and contrast drawing the eye towards the peaking orange bottles and colors of the pills and left the background white after blending the Rorschach Test on top of the bottles of medication with “light color” in Blending Options. I liked the idea of a white background not only because it makes the colors really pop out, but also because it reminded me of the plain walls of psychiatric facilities that try to keep patients calm and untriggered, despite having feelings of chaos going on inside.</p>
