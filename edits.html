  <p>The composition I was going for was more of a vintage, early 2000s New York feel.<br/> The image is not fully in focus which added to the story in that it could have easily been taken on a disposable or early digital camera,<br/> and as I kept editing, I was immediately reminded of my childhood. I could easily see the amber color time stamp in the bottom right corner, and it felt timeless.<br/> The architecture and people of the city may change, but the culture never does. New York is the hustle and bustle capital of the world. <i>The</i> concrete jungle.</p>

<p>At first, I did my best to emphasize the pigments of the umbrellas but in doing so, highlighted the digital rainbow across the street,<br/> and smaller colored parts of the trucks that were not as noticeable before. The photo again, is unfocused, but I think that adds to the allure of the bright colors,<br/> transporting you from the corner of Hunter College at Lexington Avenue and straight to the state fair.<br/> <i>The Last Days of Summer.</i></p>
